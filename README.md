**Beechcraft Aircraft Classification** ðŸš€

**Overview**

This project focuses on classifying Beechcraft aircraft using machine learning. The model is trained on aircraft-related data, distinguishing Beechcraft models from other aircraft types with high accuracy.

**Features**

âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleans and processes aircraft data for better model performance.
âœ… Feature Engineering â€“ Extracts key features relevant to Beechcraft classification.
âœ… Machine Learning Model â€“ Uses RandomForestClassifier / XGBoost / CNN (modify as per your model) for classification.
âœ… Evaluation Metrics â€“ Assesses performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes various aircraft parameters such as:

Aircraft model
Wing type
Engine type
Weight category
Other relevant features
Installation & Usage
